Hash Map

In this assignment, you will implement the Map class using a hash map as the inderlying structure rather than a linked list.
The easiest approach to this assignment is to start with your implementation of Map using a linked list and 
then adapt it from a single head value to an array of head values that each point to an independent linked list. 
We use the getBucket() function to choose the appropriate linked list head from the array of head values.


This implementation is based on lecture from Dr. Charles Severance
